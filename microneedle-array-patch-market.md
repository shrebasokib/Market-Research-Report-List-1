<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microneedle Array Patch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Microneedles</li><li>Hollow Microneedles</li><li>Coated Microneedles</li><li>Dissolvable/Dissolving Microneedles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The microneedle array patch market comprises four main types. Solid microneedles penetrate the skin for delivering vaccines or drugs without carrying the substance themselves. Hollow microneedles, equipped with a channel, enable fluid delivery directly into the dermis. Coated microneedles are coated with a drug that dissolves upon skin insertion, releasing the medication. Dissolvable or dissolving microneedles dissolve completely into the skin after insertion, eliminating the need for needle disposal and enhancing patient compliance in therapeutic applications.</p></p>
